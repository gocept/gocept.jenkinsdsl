=======================================
The sturcture of the configuration file
=======================================

[DEFAULT]
=========

Configuration for every job. Can be changed for each individual job later.

For some options a prefix is included in the option name, e.g. ``svn`` for subversion, which represent a class in the resulting groovy code.


Version control system
----------------------

vcs
    VCS used, currently supported ``svn`` or ``hg``

Subversion
++++++++++

svn_baseurl
    root URL to find the project
svn_group
    Infix which bundles a group of repositories
svn_name
    Name of the repository, defaults to section name
svn_postfix
    Postfix to build the job for, defaults to ``trunk``

The SVN URL is formed as
``svn_baseurl + '/' [+ svn_group + '/'] + svn_name + '/' + svn_postfix``

svn_credentials
    UUID of the credentials
svn_realm
    BasicAuth realm for the svn server. When set, additional credentials will be configured.
svn_scm_browser
    System of SCM browser, for example ``hudson.plugins.redmine.RedmineRepositoryBrowser``

Mercurial
+++++++++

hg_baseurl
    root URL to find the project
hg_group
    Infix which bundles a group of repositories (e.g. repository owner)
hg_name
    Name of the repository, defaults to section name
hg_branch
    Branch to build the job for, defaults to ``default``

The HG URL is formed as
``hg_baseurl + '/' [+ hg_group + '/'] + hg_name``

hg_scm_browser
    System of SCM browser, for example ``hudson.plugins.mercurial.browser.Kallithea``
hg_scm_browser_url
    Location, where the SCM browser can be found

Testbuilder
-----------

Build commands are used as .format templates, which get the content of the section passed.

builder
    Type of builder used, currently supported ``pytest`` or ``custom``

py.test builder
+++++++++++++++

pytest_timeout
    Time after which the build is aborted in minutes.
pytest_python_name
    Name of the Python installation in the Jenkins global config.
pytest_base_commands
    The basic buildout commands
pytest_additional_commands
    Additional commands when ``builder = pytest``. It should contain at least the ``--junitxml`` option to give out test results.
pytest_junit_filename
    Name of generated JUnit XML file. It is required when ``builder = pytest``.
pytest_coverage_filename
    Name of the possibly created coverage XML file.
pytest_htmlcov_path
    Name of the possibly created HTML coverage directory.
pytest_pep8_filename
    Name of the possibly created pep8 logfile. ``pep8`` should be called in commands.

Custom builder
++++++++++++++

custom_timeout
    Time after which the build is aborted in minutes.
custom_python_name
    Name of the Python installation in the Jenkins global config.
custom_base_commands
    The basic buildout commands
custom_additional_commands
    Additional command when ``builder = custom``

Redmine
-------

redmine_website_name
    Name of a globaly configured Redmine website
redmine_project_name
    Name of the project in the Redmine, where the repository browser is defined


Individual job desciption
=========================

An individual job is configured in a separate section, where the sectionname is the name of the job in the jenkins. All configuration options from the defaults can be overwritten.


Example
=======

Example configuration for this package::

    [DEFAULT]
    hg_baseurl = https://bitbucket.org
    hg_group = gocept

    builder = pytest
    pytest_timeout = 40
    pytest_base_commands =
        \$PYTHON_EXE bootstrap.py
        bin/buildout
    pytest_additional_commands =
        bin/test

    [gocept.jenkinsdsl]
    vcs = hg
    builder = pytest


Interpolation
=============

It is possible to reuse code or configuration snippets by referencing a section option with ``{}``. Nested snippets are basically supported, but the option referenced to should be defined befor the reference. Otherwise the templating results will be undefined. Snippets should not start with a prefix already associated to a class in the groovy file, as these options would be given to the contructor of the groovy class.

Example::

    [DEFAULT]

    pytest_base_commands =
        bin/buildout -c {buildout_file}
    pytest_buildout_file = blob.cfg
    path = path/to/buildout_folder
    combined_path = {path}/{pytest_buildout_file}
    custom_base_commands =
        bin/buildout -c {combined_path}
